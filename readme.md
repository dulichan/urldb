This application is built to learn more about what python can do for me.
We are going to build a url database. We are going to query the reddit api
and get urls and store them inside of postgres database and later attach a Qt interface
read and mine the database. 

Tasks needs to be completed-
	1) Learn how to install modules for python
	
	2) Connect to postgres database and try out insertion
	
	3) Bulid the schema for postgres database
	
	4) Get links from reddit api
	
	5) Save them to postgres
	
	6) Create an interface with Qt
	
All the code is going to be up in github to help others to kick-start python.
